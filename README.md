# Basic Calculator App

### Vanilla JavaScript Project

#### Project description

##### Let's create a sleek and modern calculator with all necessary buttons including numbers, operators, equal sign, and clear button. Type any arithmetic expression and the calculator will solve it instantly. We'll use JavaScript's 'eval' function to evaluate the expressions. Also, we'll learn to add event listeners to buttons with a for loop. Expect hovering and shadow effects inside and outside some elements to enhance the design.

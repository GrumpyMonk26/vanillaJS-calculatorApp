# Basic Calculator App

### Vanilla JavaScript Project

#### Project description

##### Join us in creating a stylish and contemporary calculator featuring all essential buttons: numbers, operators, the equal sign, and a clear button. With this calculator, you can effortlessly enter any arithmetic expression, and it will be solved instantly. To evaluate the expressions, we'll harness the power of JavaScript's 'eval' function. Furthermore, we'll employ a for loop to efficiently add event listeners to the buttons. In order to elevate the design, expect captivating hovering effects and carefully crafted shadows, enhancing the calculator's aesthetic appeal inside and out.
